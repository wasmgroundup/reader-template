# ðŸ§± WebAssembly from the Ground Up

Welcome! We've initialized a new project template for you. You can copy the
code from the book into the files in the root directory.

Here are some useful commands:

- `npm test` to run all tests for all chapters.
- `node <filename>` to run tests for a specific chapter.
  E.g., `node chapter01.js` for Chapter 1.
